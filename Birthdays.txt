A birthday is the anniversary of the birth of a person, or figuratively of an institution. ys of people are celebrated in numerous cultures, often with birthday gifts, birthday cards, a birthday party, or a rite of passage.
Birthday occur every year.
Many religions celebrate the birth of their founders or religious figures with special holidays (e.g. Christmas, Mawlid, Buddha's Birthday, and Krishna Janmashtami).

There is a distinction between birthday and birthdate: The former, other than February 29, occurs each year (e.g. January 15), while the latter is the exact date a person was born (e.g., January 15, 2001).

I copied the original text from the Birthdays.txt data and put some extra text into this file, to see how it looks when the merging begins.
